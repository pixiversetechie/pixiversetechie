Solution for Maintaining Organizational Structure using the Adjacency List Model
Problem Statement
We need to maintain the hierarchical structure of users in our organization. Each user can have other users reporting to them. We want to store this data in PostgreSQL and efficiently query the organizational hierarchy.

Proposed Solution
To store and manage the hierarchical data, we will use the Adjacency List model. This method is simple and easy to understand. In this model, each user record will have a reference to their supervisor (manager), forming a parent-child relationship.

Step-by-Step Solution
Create the Users Table:

We will create a table called users to store user information. Each user will have a unique identifier called kerberos, their name, and a reference to their supervisor's kerberos.

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    kerberos VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    supervisor_kerberos VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (supervisor_kerberos) REFERENCES users(kerberos) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
id: A unique identifier for each user.
kerberos: The unique identifier for each user (Kerberos ID).
name: The name of the user.
supervisor_kerberos: The Kerberos ID of the user's supervisor. This creates a link between a user and their supervisor.
Insert Sample Data:

Hereâ€™s how we can insert some sample data to represent our organizational structure:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO users (kerberos, name, supervisor_kerberos) VALUES 
('user1', 'Alice', NULL),      -- Alice has no supervisor (top-level)
('user2', 'Bob', 'user1'),     -- Bob reports to Alice
('user3', 'Charlie', 'user1'), -- Charlie reports to Alice
('user4', 'David', 'user2');   -- David reports to Bob
In this example:

Alice is at the top level with no supervisor.
Bob and Charlie report directly to Alice.
David reports to Bob.
Query the Hierarchy:

To find all users reporting directly or indirectly to a specific supervisor (e.g., Alice), we can use a recursive query. This query helps us fetch the entire hierarchy under a given user.

sql
Copy code
WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
    SELECT id, kerberos, name, supervisor_kerberos
    FROM users
    WHERE kerberos = 'user1' -- Replace 'user1' with the supervisor's kerberos ID

    UNION ALL

    SELECT u.id, u.kerberos, u.name, u.supervisor_kerberos
    FROM users u
    INNER JOIN subordinates s ON s.kerberos = u.supervisor_kerberos
)
SELECT * FROM subordinates;
This query will return all users who report to 'user1' (Alice) directly or through other supervisors.

Benefits of Using the Adjacency List Model
Simplicity: The model is easy to understand and implement.
Flexibility: It allows us to easily add or update users and their supervisors.
Maintainability: The database structure is straightforward, making it easier to maintain.
Considerations
Depth of Hierarchy: If the hierarchy is very deep, the recursive queries might become slower. However, for most typical organizational structures, this model works efficiently.
Cyclic Relationships: Care should be taken to avoid cycles (a user being their own supervisor, directly or indirectly), which can be managed via application logic or database constraints.
